What is a Database?
-> Data + Base 
Storage + (computation=use of Data)



//Before the computer
1> Memorize => spread or transfer to others


computers can help us to
1> store data \
2> use data   /

why?
popular Application  //without database almost not possible to make application... now a days
example-: fb,insta,Linkdein

photos uploaded on fb =>how?
fb uses database => imgs/contents/friends

storage of data + computati on of the same data
//Data driven decision -  Data is the new oil


File Based Storage System
what?
- in simple term - storing the data into files

like 
     for windows                For Linux 

     c drive                    Root Directory           
         |                            |
---------|--------              ------|-------
|                |              |     |      |
Folder        Folder           File  File   File
   |             |
-------        Video
|     |         File
Txt  Img    
file File
(Data)

Why file Based Storage System?
Advantage- 
1) very easy to use
2) No Complication involved
3) Easily Copied and stored at multiple locations

Example ->
Like i am working for a company


Account Dep                                Organization
Name                                             Name
Address        <----company ---->                 Dept
Phone No               |                      phone no
Dept                   |                       Manager
Bank AC                |                      Reporting

                  HR Dept 
                   Name
                   Address
                   phone No.
                    Role
                   Reoprting

Storing same things at multiple places is called Redundancy => thas was the big problem with FBSS

Challenges of FBSS
1) Redundancy --Multiple copies of same Data at multiple places
Read Anamoly
stale Data
Update anamoly
write --

2)Security Concerns

3)Time Taking process

4)Difficulty in concurrent user
like abc.txt somone is trying to read others have to wait
no talks about speed that time
Limitations and challenges are the mother of inventions

Schema
Blue print of whole DataBase   or  information about database
examples 
All tables
Table names
Table Attributes
Relationship b/w tables
Different types of Function

DataBase instance
t=0 no data 
t=t1 100mb of data stored   // like at time t1 we are looking for what type of data is there what is the relationship of the data at that specific point of time is called Database instances
t=t2 5gb of data stored


Three Schema Architecture

internal Schema -- how data is stored and retrived in HardD
conceptual schema -- entire Data set that can be arraenged in  the forms of table what is the relationship in table 
external Schema -- id|name|salary|Age-->different differnt consumer like for finance it will be salary wala table 
   parts of same table that customers wants

Advantages/Why?

Customized data-> providing customized data for end users
Logical Data independence 
physical Data independence  -- we can change that algo earlier used for customized data without telling th ecustomers
 

Data Base Management System (DBMS)
eg) MySql,Oracle,MongoDB can i call it database?
these are not only database these are database management system

first Brand of photocopy named was Xerox
first Detergent Brand was surf  

DBMS?????????
DataBase -->physical layer where we store our data
Database + Management System => (lared of managemenrt)code/program around Database
DBMS is nothing but its a Software


improvement of FBSS
DBMS like PMO office
DataBAse is like Mr Modi
layerd of Z+ Security no one can meet directly is like Management or management layer

Database High secure 
Multi layer Authentification
We can reduce/avoid redudancy
